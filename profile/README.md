_Inogda_ means "sometimes" in Russian. We find this word hopeful and forgiving. 

Sometimes we are creative, and sometimes not in the mood. Sometimes we channel ideas and energy, and sometimes we are shut off. And this is all right.

We make things. Sometimes apps, sometimes games, sometimes art, sometimes music. 

Sometimes we just let it speak for itself.
